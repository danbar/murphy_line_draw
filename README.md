# Murphy's line algorithm

The Matlab function `murphy_line_draw.m` implements Murphy's line algorithm [1] to draw lines of arbitrary thickness.
It is a modified version of Bresenham's line algorithm [2].
Further information can be found on http://www.zoo.co.uk/~murphy/thickline/.

This implementation works in all octants of the Cartesian coordinate system.

## Demo

The Matlab script `demo.m` provides a simple example of how to use the Matlab function `murphy_line_draw.m`.
